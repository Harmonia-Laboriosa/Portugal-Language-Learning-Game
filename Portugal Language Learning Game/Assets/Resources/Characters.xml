        Ah, yes! If I remember correctly, to reach the VC, you need to go through two difficult challenges. First, you have to unlock the entrance to the cave. But be careful... Mistakes will cost you dearly!
        <Response next="3">
          How can I do that?

        You have to go through a series of challenges that will take you to a village of wizards. But remember... Each mistake can block your entry.
        <Response next="4">
          Where is the village?

      <Tree4>
        There's a portal in the cave that takes you to the village. There, you have to adapt to their customs. Dress like them, speak like them, eat like them. That way, you'll gain their trust. Then, the wizards will help you find the castle where the VC is kept.
        <Response next="5">
          How do I get into the castle?

      <Tree5>
        After gaining the trust of the wizards, you have to gain the trust of the castle guards. Dress like one of them and pass their tests. If you succeed, you'll have access to the castle. The VC is there.
        <Response next="6">
          So, now do I have everything to get the VC?

        </Response>
      </Tree5>
      <Tree6>
        No. You still have to solve one last challenge. In the end, the VC can finally be yours. Are you up to the challenges?
        <Response next="7">
          Yes.

        The cheapest is to go by bike or on foot, takes between 20 to 25 minutes.
